## JournAI
A reflective journaling assistant powered by large language models (LLMs) to support mental health and emotional insight.

## Overview
**JournAI** is a personal reflection tool that leverages the capabilities of GPT-4 to help users explore their thoughts and feelings through guided journaling. It offers real-time feedback, sentiment analysis, and stores entries to track mood trends over time.
